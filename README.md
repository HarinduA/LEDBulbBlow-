This is an Arduino program to create a lighting effect with LEDs on an Arduino Uno, there are several interesting patterns I tried.

                        EX: 1. Single LED Blinking
                            2. Multiple LEDs Sequential Blinking
                            3. LED Chase Effect
                            4. Random LED Blinking
